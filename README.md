Task 10
Write a complete Python script for Google Colab that performs JPEG-like compression on color images. The script should allow the user to upload any color image interactively, compress each color channel (R, G, B) independently using 8×8 block-based Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT), quantization, and inverse DCT, and include a Huffman coding step on one channel for demonstration. It should compute and print Compression Ratio (CR), Mean Squared Error (MSE), Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR), and Rate-Distortion (RD), and display the original image, the compressed image, and an amplified difference image to clearly visualize compression artifacts. The script should allow adjusting the compression strength via a scale_factor variable, use matplotlib for displaying images, and ensure that even small compression differences are visible in the difference image.
